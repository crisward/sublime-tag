# sublime-tag

Sublime syntax highlighting for [Riot JS](https://github.com/riot/riot/) TAG files.
Witin sublime you can use HTML, but this doesn't work well with coffeescript.

With this plugin you can use

```
<yourtag>
  <script type="test/coffeescript">
    # your coffee script here
  </script>
</yourtag>
```
This will then have correct syntax highlighting.


### Jade Support

I've been messing a little with the jade support in riot, again having syntax
issues when combining with coffeescript. Jade can compile the coffeescript itself
but I had a few issues with this. To use the jade support follow the same
instructions below, but selet Riot(Jade) as the syntax.

```jade
yourtag
  p hello world

  script(type="text/coffeescript").
    # your coffee script here

```

You'll then need to make sure your riotify settings are correct in your
package.json file

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "watch": "watchify src/app.coffee -o build/app.js"
  },
  "browserify": {
    "transform": [
      ["riotify",{"expr": false,"type": "coffee","template": "jade"}]
    ]
  }
}

```
