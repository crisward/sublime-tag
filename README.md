# sublime-tag

Sublime syntax highlighting for Riot JS TAG files.
Witin sublime you can use HTML, but this doesn't work well with coffeescript.

With this plugin you can use

```
<yourtag>
  <script type="test/coffeescript">
    # your coffee script here
  </script>
</yourtag>
```
This will then have correct syntax highlighting.
